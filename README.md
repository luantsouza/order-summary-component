# About

This is my third project uploaded to Github. It's a challenge from the site 'Frontend Mentor', that shows a order summary card in the middle of the page containing some information to the user, like what the service offers and the price of the plan. I only used HTML5 and CSS3. Hope you appreciate my job. :)
